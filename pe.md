## 2. Using Sense HAT to Collect Environmental Data

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi that has a set of environmental sensors for detecting the surrounding conditions, including gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, temperature, barometric pressure and humidity. There are tons of interesting [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?hardware[]=sense-hat) that can be made using Sense HAT.

For this tutorial, we will use Sense HAT to measure pressure, temperature, and humidity. We will use Python to run the program, and learn how to store the collected data into a CSV file (please refer to  [`01_env_sensor.py`](01_env_sensor.py).)

In a Python file, enter the following codes:
```Python
# Import the sense_hat module and instantiate a SenseHat object
from sense_hat import SenseHat
sense = SenseHat()
sense.clear()

pressure = sense.get_pressure()
temperature = sense.get_temperature()
humidity = sense.get_humidity()

print("pressure: %.2f, temperature: %.2f, humidity: %.2f" % (pressure, temperature, humidity))
```
After running the program, you should get something like this:
```Python
pressure: 1010.81, temperature: 37.74, humidity: 31.91
```
It would be useful if the data can be stored somewhere. For this exercise, we will store our environmental data in to a CSV file named `env.csv` within the `assets` folder. To write the data to a file, you first need to create it. At the end of the program, add the following line:
```Python
with open("assets/env.csv", "a", encoding="utf8") as fp:
```
This creates a new file called `env.csv` and opens it in "append" mode, so that lines are only written to the end of the file. Now you want to write the current timestamp, pressure, temperature, humidity data to `env.csv`:
```Python
with open("assets/env.csv", "a", encoding="utf8") as fp:
  fp.write("%d, %.2f, %.2f, %.2f \n" % (timestamp, pressure, temperature, humidity))
```
Each time you run the entire program, a new row of data will be added to the `env.csv` file.

To learn more about what a Sense Hat can do, please refer to the Python libraries at https://github.com/astro-pi/python-sense-hat.

## 3. Monitoring the Environmental Variables with Real-Time GIS
<!--
[client(RPI)] <-> Server <-> [Cloud Storage(GitHub(command line), Dropbox[python dropbox], Google Drive[python google dirve], Linux[rsync])]
-->

Now we have the data stored in our local drive, let's synchronize those data to the cloud, in this case, GitHub. With real-time GIS, you will have the ability to simultaneously tap into, analyze, and display streaming data collected from the Raspberry Pi sensors.

### 3.1 Synchronizing Data to GitHub
In the  [`iot.sh`](iot.sh) file, we (1) pull the latest data from GitHub (2) run the [`01_env_sensor.py`](01_env_sensor.py) to collect pressure, temperature, and humidity data and (3) add and commit changes (4) push the collected data back to GitHub, as shown below:


```shell
cd /home/pi/rpi-iot
sudo git pull https://[github-username]:[github-passowrd]@github.com/jakobzhao/rpi-iot.git
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/rpi-iot/01_env_sensor.py
sudo git add .
sudo git commit -a -m 'Env Bot'
sudo git push https://[github-username]:[github-passowrd]@github.com/jakobzhao/rpi-iot.git
```
With this process, you will be able to monitor the collected data remotely in real time.

### 3.2 Setting up `crontab` to Automate Tasks

When using the Raspberry Pi, many times you may have a program you want to automatically start it at boot so that you can use your project without logging in to the Raspberry Pi via SSH or VNC. Automating scripts is simple with `crontab`. Cron is part of the Raspbian operating system which is used to schedule commands or scripts to run periodically and at fixed intervals.

This command is especially useful when you want to run a program in a Raspberry Pi without a monitor. For this exercise, I connected the Raspberry Pi with a solar charger and set it up by the window to measure the changes in pressure, temperature, and humidity in my room. I set up `crontab` to execute `01_env_sensor.py` every minute. This is how the setting looks like:

![RPi remote setup](img/rpi_solar.jpg)


Now, let's learn how to auto-run Python programs on the Raspberry Pi.

- To begin, open up a terminal window.
- Run `crontab` with the `-e` flag to edit the cron table:

```shell
crontab -e
```
- When you first run the `crontab -e` command, you will be asked to select an editor to use. For now, let's use `/bin/nano`.

- In the `crontab` editor, you can add new cron jobs with this syntax:
```powershell
    *    *    *    *    *  COMMABD TO BE EXECUTED
    │    │    │    │    │─────────── Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
    │    │    │    │──────────────── Month (1 - 12)
    │    │    │───────────────────── Day of month (1 - 31)
    │    │────────────────────────── Hour (0 - 23)
    │─────────────────────────────── Minute (0 - 59)
```

- For this exercise, we will run the `iot.sh` file every minute (to learn how to schedule time, please refer to https://crontab.guru/). We can automate this process using `crontab` with the following code:

```shell
* * * * * sh [local_repository_path]/iot.sh # run iot.sh every minute
```
- To exit the editing environment, press `Crtl+X` and then `Y`.
- To activate the `crontab` schedule, type:

```shell
sudo service cron restart
```
- To check if the `crontab` is executed successfully, type:

```shell
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep CRON
```
Now, as long as there is power supply, the Raspberry Pi will automatically collect environmental data and update them to the cloud. With this, you can monitor the real-time data via GitHub remotely!

## 4. Running TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi

To enhance my experience of working with the Raspberry Pi, I included a tutorial for setting up TensorFlow Lite, which runs faster than regualr TensorFlow models, on the Raspberry Pi and using it to run object detection models provided by Google.

### 4.1 Updating the Raspberry Pi
To begin, please update the Raspberry Pi by typing the following commands in the terminal:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
Make sure your Camera is enabled, as shown as section 1.2.4 in this practical exercise.

### 4.2 Creating a Virtual Environmental
Next, clone this GitHub repository to your Raspberry Pi. This downloads the scripts to run TensorFlow Lite into a folder called TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi. Since the original name of the folder is too long, rename the folder to "tflite1" and then change the directory into it:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi.git
mv TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi tflite1
cd tflite1
```
Next, let's create a virtual environment called `tflite1-env` to prevent any conflicts between versions of package libraries that may already be installed on your Raspberry Pi.

Install virtualenv, create the `tflite1-env` virtual environment, and activate the environment with the following commands:
```shell
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv tflite1-env
source tflite1-env/bin/activate
```

### 4.3 Installing TensorFlow Dependencies and OpenCV
Next, we'll install TensorFlow, OpenCV, and all the dependencies needed for both packages. OpenCV is not needed to run TensorFlow Lite, but the object detection scripts in this repository use it to grab images and draw detection results on them.

Run the following command to automatically download and install all the packages and dependencies:
```shell
bash get_pi_requirements.sh
```
_If you get an error, it's mostly because the downloaded package data was corrupted while your internet connection is timed-out. Try re-running the command a few more times._

### 4.4 Setting Up TensorFlow Lite Detection Models
Next, we'll set up the object detection model that will be used with TensorFlow Lite. While you can also use a model that you've trained, we will use a sample TensorFlow Lite model provided by Google for this exercise.

Google provides a sample quantized SSDLite-MobileNet-v2 object detection model which is trained off the MSCOCO dataset and converted to run on TensorFlow Lite. It can detect and identify 80 different common objects, such as people, cars, cups, etc.

Download Google's sample model with this command:
```shell
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29.zip
```
Unzip it to a folder called `Sample_TFLite_model` by issuing (this command automatically creates the folder):
```shell
unzip coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29.zip -d Sample_TFLite_model
```
And now the sample model is all ready to go!

### 4.5 Running the TensorFlow Lite Model
Finally, It's time to see the TensorFlow Lite object detection model in action! Please make sure your Pi Camera is connected.

Run the real-time webcam detection script by issuing the following command from inside the /home/pi/tflite1 directory. (Before running the command, make sure the tflite1-env environment is active by checking that (tflite1-env) appears in front of the command prompt.)
```shell
python3 TFLite_detection_webcam.py --modeldir=Sample_TFLite_model
```
After a few moments of initializing, a window will appear showing the webcam feed. Detected objects will have bounding boxes and labels displayed on them in real time!

## 5. Deliverable

For the deliverable of this practical excercise, you are expected to collect continous environment data and save it into a github repository. (40 POINTS)

You are also expected to store the python and shell scripts to the repository (5 POINTS) and summarize what you have done in the readme.md (5 POINTS)


Create a repository to store the screenshots and then summarize your work in the `readme.md` file, and insert the screenshots to the `readme.md` file too (10 POINTS).

Also, we encourage you try to visualize the colected data using charts. Please refer to the [index.html](index.html) script under the 08_iot folder. This script can be openly accessed from this link: https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog595/08_iot/.

![webpage](img/web.png)


To submit your deliverable, please share the url of the Github repository to the **Canvas Dropbox** of this practical exercise. The file structure of this github repository should look like below.


```powershell
[your_repository]
    │
    │readme.md
    ├─assets
    │    env.csv  # a timely updated data file of the monitored environmental parameters.
```


**Note:** Lab assignments are required to be submitted electronically to Canvas unless stated otherwise. Efforts will be made to have them graded and returned within one week after they are submitted.Lab assignments are expected to be completed by the due date. ***A late penalty of at least 10 percentage units will be taken off each day after the due date.*** If you have a genuine reason(known medical condition, a pile-up of due assignments on other courses, ROTC,athletics teams, job interview, religious obligations etc.) for being unable to complete work on time, then some flexibility is possible. However, if in my judgment you could reasonably have let me know beforehand that there would likely be a delay, and then a late penalty will still be imposed if I don't hear from you until after the deadline has passed. For unforeseeable problems,I can be more flexible. If there are ongoing medical, personal, or other issues that are likely to affect your work all semester, then please arrange to see me to discuss the situation. There will be NO make-up exams except for circumstances like those above.
